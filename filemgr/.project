  <comment>The file management component of a Catalog and Archive Service. This component
     purposefully separates data stores and metadata stores as standard interfaces, and
     provides some out of the box backend implementations of them (including one based
     on the javax.sql.DataSource interface). This component provides everything that you need
     to catalog, archive and manage files, and directories, and their associated metadata.</comment>
