    <p>OODT query service software.  The query service provides a
      gateway into the network of profile servers and product servers.
    </p>
    <p>Normally, you can query profile servers and product servers
      directly, so the query service isn't always necessary.  However,
      the query service does provide one function that direct profile
      queries don't: spidering.
    </p>
    <p>When a profile server has profiles that refer to <em>other</em>
      profile servers, the query server will follow such links and
      query them, too.  It thus follows a digraph of profile servers,
      collecting results from each, and returning the mass result as a
      single query transaction.
