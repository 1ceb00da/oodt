  <description>This component provides a way to express queries in a generic
    manner.  Its centerpiece is a class called XMLQuery that uses
    boolean postfix expressions to capture the domain, range, and
    constraint of a query, regardless of the source of the query (SQL,
    keyword query, etc.).  It can also encapsulate the results of a
    query.  It's used by many other components as the standard way to
    pass a query and its results between servers, clients, nodes, and
    other components.</description>
