 A Multi-valued, generic Metadata container schema. The class uses a map of 
 string keys pointing to vectors of strings. The data structure looks like 
 the following: 

[std:string key]=><std:vector of std:strings>

The multi-valued nature of the class is handled transparently by this Metadata
container. Since all values are stored internally as string vectors, the difference
between a scalar value and a non-scalar is handled by determing whether the list of
values for a particular key is greater than 1.
